# PCA Exploration

This repository contains a hands-on Jupyter Notebook for learning Principal Component Analysis (PCA) through two examples:

1. **2D PCA demo**  
   - Generate a synthetic 2-dimensional dataset with correlated features  
   - Compute and visualize its principal axes  
   - Project the data onto those axes to reveal its intrinsic structure  

2. **Iris dataset PCA**  
   - Standardize the classic 4-feature Iris dataset  
   - Reduce it to 2 principal components  
   - Plot and examine how well the species separate in 2D
